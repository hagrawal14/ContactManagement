1. Frontend Development:
- Create a user-friendly contact listing interface that displays the imported contacts.
- Implement pagination for the contact listing. Each page should display a limited number
of contacts (e.g., 10 contacts per page and be able to increase the size).
- Provide navigation controls for users to switch between pages.
- The contact listing UI should include the contact's name, phone number, email, and any
other relevant fields.
2. Contact Import:
- Allow users to import contacts from both CSV and Excel files.
- Implement validation to ensure that the imported files are in the correct format.
- Display appropriate error messages if the imported file format is invalid.
- Create a button or UI element to trigger the contact import process.
3. Backend Development:
- Set up a Node.js server using Express.js to handle API requests.
- Create RESTful APIs to handle the contact import functionality.
- Implement logic to parse and process the imported CSV and Excel files.
- Store the imported contacts in a MongoDB database.
